\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-11 (2016-06-29)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new argument \code{"fancyhdr"} in \code{klausur.report()} to add information to headers
        and footers of generated reports
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item cleaned up \code{klausur.report()}: moved internal functions to separate file
      \item adjusted the auto table sizes in \code{klausur.report()} a bit
      \item rephrased the description to comply with CRAN terms
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-10 (2015-02-07)}{
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item support for pick-n scoring was added to \code{klausur()}
      \item new slot \code{"distractor.analysis"} in objects of class klausuR, listing the
        selected answer alternatives for each individual item and some statistics
        like correlation with the overall results and mean results of subjects
        chosing an alternative
      \item new element \code{"wrong"} in slot \code{"corr"} of klausur.answ class items for pick-n
        scoring
      \item new argument \code{"wrong"} in \code{klausur.data()} for the same reason
      \item \code{klausur.report()} gained options from \code{sort()} for \code{"anon"} and \code{"glob"} results
      \item new elements \code{"keep.cases"} and \code{"recode.na"} in \code{klausur.data()}, to keep
        cases with missing data, even if "na.rm=TRUE"
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item stripping trailing whitespace from answer data if it is in factor of
        character format. this happens easily if data was imported from SPSS and can
        cause nasty problems, because the whitespace characters are interpreted by
        \code{klausur()} as a valid but wrong answer
      \item removed typos in \code{klausur.repost()} code (\code{"appen"} instead of \code{"append"})
      \item anonymous feedback output is now sorted by points as a default. the
        previous default took the order as is, which usually sorted it by family names
        of participants, which limits anonymity to a certain degree
      \item the character "'" is now also filtered out of file names
      \item breaks for axis labels in histograms are now calculated by internal
        function \code{axis.breaks()}, which fixes a problem with non-integer points
      \item \code{klausur.report()} does now also check for digits to display in global and
        anonymous feedback PDF
      \item \code{klausur.report()} now shows empty answers (\code{""}) as empty, not as a question
        mark
      \item LaTeX replacements of characters has been corrected to also match first
        character
      \item manual setting of \code{"table.size"} was buggy in \code{klausur.report()}, adding just
        the word of the chosen size to the table
      \item \code{klausur.mufo()} was using outdated object classes
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item polycor was added as a dependency (needed for distractor analysis)
      \item some code cleaning in \code{klausur()} for better readability
      \item added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
      \item replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters
      \item moved the internal helper function \code{find.partial()} out of the function
        body of \code{partial()} for cleaner code
      \item show method for klausuR results now also reports distractor analysis, if
        found
      \item partial points are no longer rounded before end results are calculated
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-9 (2013-08-05)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item pdfLaTeX became picky and didn't work with the table of marks any more.
        set \code{print.xtable()} to use floating=FALSE to fix this.
      \item added some more character filtering on generated filenames which could
        cause LaTeX to fail with an error
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-8 (2013-05-08)}{
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item no real new features, restructured the source code layout, as roxygen2
        doesn't seem to get collate info easy with R 3.0.0 ...
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-7 (2013-01-25)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item corrected LaTeX output (carets)
      \item added missing date stamps in ChangeLog for releases prior to version
        0.12-1, using the repo archive
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item item analysis now includes Lienert's selection index (selektionskennwert)
      \item debianized sources
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-6 (2012-04-14)}{

      \item force item names into expected letter case
      \item corrected LaTeX output (filtering of problematic characters)
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-5 (2012-03-10)}{
  \itemize{
    \item replaced custom function to clean up LaTeX code with
      \code{encoded_text_to_latex()} from tools package in \code{klausur.report()}
    \item replaced UTF-8 characters with \\uxxxx escapes in \code{klausur.report()}
    \item set some internal variables NULL in \code{compare()}, \code{grand.table()},
      \code{klausur.gen()}, \code{klausur.mufo()}, \code{klausur.report()} and the internal function
      \code{klausur.reorderItems()}, to avoid needless NOTEs from "R CMD check"
    \item re-formatted the ChangeLog to have the roxyPackage translate it into a
      NEWS.Rd file
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-4 (2012-02-09)}{
  \itemize{
    \item fixed bug in \code{compare()}: \code{"new.set"} didn't work if exactly one or none
      differences were found
    \item added 'maxp' option to klausur.answ-class and \code{klausur.date()}, to be able
      to compensate for really buggy tests...
    \item adjusted \code{klausur()} to check for maxp
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-3 (2011-10-04)}{
  \itemize{
    \item added option \code{"merge"} to \code{klausur.report()}, to merge all individual reports
      into one file
    \item added status feedback to  \code{klausur.report()}, can be turned of with new
      option "quiet=TRUE"
    \item updated the RKWard GUI to the new options

  \itemize{
    \item cleaned the docs so package check runs fine
    \item fixed typo in \code{klausur.report()}
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.12-0 (2011-08-30)}{
  \itemize{
    \item 0.12 is not fully downward compatible with earlier versions of the
      klausuR package!
    \item drastic changes: \code{klausur()} and \code{klausur.mufo()} from now on only take
      objects of the new class klausur.answ, which replaces the 'answ' and 'corr'
      arguments completely. Most of the time it took to evaluate tests was
      squeezing data with exotic variable names and loads of surprises into a valid
      data.frame. Those days should finally be numbered now...
    \item added function \code{klausur.data()} to do the squeezing into klausur.answ class
      objects (s.o.)
    \item added scoring function NRET+, which is more conservative than NRET when
      it comes to errors
    \item added function \code{nret.rescale()} to change scaling of points in result
      objects (NR/ET/NRET/NRET+)
    \item added function \code{grand.table()} to export all results back to CSV format
    \item the class klausuR gained a new slot 'misc' to preserve whatever unused
      variables are left over from the squeezing process.
    \item introduced class klausuR.test, now as a placeholder for future releases,
      and added slots to classes klausuR and klausuR.answ
    \item added function \code{nret.translator()} to convert NRET/ET data from/to SPSS
    \item added options 'table.size' and 'NRET.legend' to \code{klausur.report()}
    \item smarter handling of histograms and marks info in \code{klausur.report()}
    \item \code{klausur.report()} can now also create histograms with data from several
      klausuR objects
    \item \code{klausur.report()} can now produce reports from more than one object, if
      you give them in a list
    \item \code{klausur.compare()} was renamed to \code{compare()} and can now cope with NAs,
      unequal cases and unequal variables (will cause verbose warnings), and rename
      input variables, if necessary. it is also no longer limited to compare
      klausuR data, hence the renaming.
    \item fixed some NRET/ET related bugs in the plot method and \code{klausur.gen.marks()}
    \item fixed 'if' statement error in show method for klausuR-class objects
    \item added support for item analysis on ET/NRET data
    \item added NRET sample data \code{"spss.data"}
    \item added SD values to item analysis (show method)
    \item added 'sort.by' option to \code{klausur.data()}, and \code{klausur()}
    \item added sort method for objects of class klausuR
    \item added the full RKWard plugin as inst/rkward, so both get updated
      simultanously
    \item adapted rkwardtests to current behaviour of klausuR
    \item sources can now be roxygenized by roxygen2 (classes docs are static until
      '@slot' is supported again)
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.11-3 (2011-06-19)}{
  \itemize{
    \item aligned penalty for false negatives to number of correct alternatives in
      NRET/ET scoring
    \item for NRET/ET, moved determination of max. points etc. to new internal
      function \code{nret.minmax()}
  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.11-2 (2011-06-17)}{

  }
}
\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.11-1 (2011-04-09)}{

\section{Changes in klausuR version 0.10-1 (2011-02-14)}{
  \itemize{

      again
    \item fixed: \code{klausur.report()} failed if "#" appeared in names
    \item fixed: \code{klausur.report()} didn't show partial results correctly, added
      check for needed digits
