ChangeLog for package klausuR

changes in version 0.12-10 (2015-02-07)
added:
  - support for pick-n scoring was added to klausur()
  - new slot "distractor.analysis" in objects of class klausuR, listing the
    selected answer alternatives for each individual item and some statistics
    like correlation with the overall results and mean results of subjects
    chosing an alternative
  - new element "wrong" in slot "corr" of klausur.answ class items for pick-n
    scoring
  - new argument "wrong" in klausur.data() for the same reason
  - klausur.report() gained options from sort() for "anon" and "glob" results
  - new elements "keep.cases" and "recode.na" in klausur.data(), to keep
    cases with missing data, even if "na.rm=TRUE"
fixed:
  - stripping trailing whitespace from answer data if it is in factor of
    character format. this happens easily if data was imported from SPSS and can
    cause nasty problems, because the whitespace characters are interpreted by
    klausur() as a valid but wrong answer
  - removed typos in klausur.repost() code ("appen" instead of "append")
  - anonymous feedback output is now sorted by points as a default. the
    previous default took the order as is, which usually sorted it by family names
    of participants, which limits anonymity to a certain degree
  - the character "'" is now also filtered out of file names
  - breaks for axis labels in histograms are now calculated by internal
    function axis.breaks(), which fixes a problem with non-integer points
  - klausur.report() does now also check for digits to display in global and
    anonymous feedback PDF
  - klausur.report() now shows empty answers ("") as empty, not as a question
    mark
  - LaTeX replacements of characters has been corrected to also match first
    character
  - manual setting of "table.size" was buggy in klausur.report(), adding just
    the word of the chosen size to the table
  - klausur.mufo() was using outdated object classes
changed:
  - polycor was added as a dependency (needed for distractor analysis)
  - some code cleaning in klausur() for better readability
  - added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
  - replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters
  - moved the internal helper function find.partial() out of the function
    body of partial() for cleaner code
  - show method for klausuR results now also reports distractor analysis, if
    found
  - partial points are no longer rounded before end results are calculated

changes in version 0.12-9 (2013-08-05)
fixed:
  - pdfLaTeX became picky and didn't work with the table of marks any more.
    set print.xtable() to use floating=FALSE to fix this.
  - added some more character filtering on generated filenames which could
    cause LaTeX to fail with an error

changes in version 0.12-8 (2013-05-08)
changed:
  - no real new features, restructured the source code layout, as roxygen2
    doesn't seem to get collate info easy with R 3.0.0 ...

changes in version 0.12-7 (2013-01-25)
fixed:
  - corrected LaTeX output (carets)
  - added missing date stamps in ChangeLog for releases prior to version
    0.12-1, using the repo archive
added:
  - item analysis now includes Lienert's selection index (selektionskennwert)
  - debianized sources

changes in version 0.12-6 (2012-04-14)
fixed:
  - check for missing items in data and/or correct answers
  - force item names into expected letter case
  - corrected LaTeX output (filtering of problematic characters)

changes in version 0.12-5 (2012-03-10)
  - replaced custom function to clean up LaTeX code with
    encoded_text_to_latex() from tools package in klausur.report()
  - replaced UTF-8 characters with \uxxxx escapes in klausur.report()
  - set some internal variables NULL in compare(), grand.table(),
    klausur.gen(), klausur.mufo(), klausur.report() and the internal function
    klausur.reorderItems(), to avoid needless NOTEs from "R CMD check"
  - re-formatted the ChangeLog to have the roxyPackage translate it into a
    NEWS.Rd file

changes in version 0.12-4 (2012-02-09)
  - fixed bug in compare(): "new.set" didn't work if exactly one or none
    differences were found
  - added 'maxp' option to klausur.answ-class and klausur.date(), to be able
    to compensate for really buggy tests...
  - adjusted klausur() to check for maxp

changes in version 0.12-3 (2011-10-04)
  - added option "merge" to klausur.report(), to merge all individual reports
    into one file
  - added status feedback to  klausur.report(), can be turned of with new
    option "quiet=TRUE"
  - updated the RKWard GUI to the new options

changes in version 0.12-2 (2011-09-11)
  - fixed bug in nret.rescale() regarding NR data
  - fixed author definition for R 2.14

changes in version 0.12-1 (2011-09-01)
  - cleaned the docs so package check runs fine
  - fixed typo in klausur.report()

changes in version 0.12-0 (2011-08-30)
  - 0.12 is not fully downward compatible with earlier versions of the
    klausuR package!
  - drastic changes: klausur() and klausur.mufo() from now on only take
    objects of the new class klausur.answ, which replaces the 'answ' and 'corr'
    arguments completely. Most of the time it took to evaluate tests was
    squeezing data with exotic variable names and loads of surprises into a valid
    data.frame. Those days should finally be numbered now...
  - added function klausur.data() to do the squeezing into klausur.answ class
    objects (s.o.)
  - added scoring function NRET+, which is more conservative than NRET when
    it comes to errors
  - added function nret.rescale() to change scaling of points in result
    objects (NR/ET/NRET/NRET+)
  - added function grand.table() to export all results back to CSV format
  - the class klausuR gained a new slot 'misc' to preserve whatever unused
    variables are left over from the squeezing process.
  - introduced class klausuR.test, now as a placeholder for future releases,
    and added slots to classes klausuR and klausuR.answ
  - added function nret.translator() to convert NRET/ET data from/to SPSS
  - added options 'table.size' and 'NRET.legend' to klausur.report()
  - smarter handling of histograms and marks info in klausur.report()
  - klausur.report() can now also create histograms with data from several
    klausuR objects
  - klausur.report() can now produce reports from more than one object, if
    you give them in a list
  - klausur.compare() was renamed to compare() and can now cope with NAs,
    unequal cases and unequal variables (will cause verbose warnings), and rename
    input variables, if necessary. it is also no longer limited to compare
    klausuR data, hence the renaming.
  - fixed some NRET/ET related bugs in the plot method and klausur.gen.marks()
  - fixed 'if' statement error in show method for klausuR-class objects
  - added support for item analysis on ET/NRET data
  - added NRET sample data "spss.data"
  - added SD values to item analysis (show method)
  - added 'sort.by' option to klausur.data(), and klausur()
  - added sort method for objects of class klausuR
  - added the full RKWard plugin as inst/rkward, so both get updated
    simultanously
  - adapted rkwardtests to current behaviour of klausuR
  - sources can now be roxygenized by roxygen2 (classes docs are static until
    '@slot' is supported again)

changes in version 0.11-3 (2011-06-19)
  - aligned penalty for false negatives to number of correct alternatives in
    NRET/ET scoring
  - for NRET/ET, moved determination of max. points etc. to new internal
    function nret.minmax()

changes in version 0.11-2 (2011-06-17)
  - added internal function roxy.package() to ease development
  - added initial support for elimination testing (ET) and number right
    elimination testing (NRET)
  - fixed "Form" addition in klausur.gen()

changes in version 0.11-1 (2011-04-09)
  - fixed bug in points (were logical instead of numeric, which caused
    trouble for PDF generation)
  - fixed annoying "show" warning

changes in version 0.10-1 (2011-02-14)
  - complete rewrite of klausur.compare(): less and more efficient code
  - replaced "na.replace" option with a plain "na.rm", i.e., NA cases are
    dropped completely by default
  - added new "na.rm" option to plot method, TRUE by default
  - added variable "Form" to klausur.gen()
  - replaced several "if(a == b)" constructs with "identical(a, b)" or
    "isTRUE(...)"
  - fixed: klausur.report() accidently created PDFs in a loop over and over
    again
  - fixed: klausur.report() failed if "#" appeared in names
  - fixed: klausur.report() didn't show partial results correctly, added
    check for needed digits
  - added slots "wght" and "points" to class klausuR

changes in version 0.10-0 (2010-11-03)
  - added klausur.mufo() and new S4 class klausuR.mult: initial support for
    parallel test forms
  - added show() and plot() methods for objects of class klausuR.mult
  - added support for objects of class klausuR.mult in klausur.report()

    "marks.sum" if wanted

changes in version 0.9-5 (2010-08-07)
  - fixed another bug in klausur.compare(): objects with NAs meant trouble.
  - added "select" option to klausur.compare() to be able to focus on certain
    variables

changes in version 0.9-4 (2010-08-06)
