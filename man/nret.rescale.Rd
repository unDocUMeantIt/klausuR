\title{Rescale test evaluation results}
\usage{
nret.rescale(res.obj, score = "NRET", points = TRUE, percent = TRUE,
  marks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{res.obj}{An object of class \code{klausuR} with results of an ET/NRET coded test.}

\item{score}{Either \code{"NR"}, \code{"ET"}, \code{"NRET"} or \code{"NRET+"},
      defining the scoring function used.}

\item{points}{Logical, whether point values should be rescaled.}

\item{percent}{Logical, whether the percentage of received points should be rescaled,
      so that 0 points are 0 percent.}

\item{marks}{Logical,
      whether the assigned marks should be rescaled to fit the rescaled points (probably a good idea).
However, this will removed the attached mark assignment vecor,
      since its indices can't be negative.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{klausuR} with rescaled results.
}
\description{
By default \code{klausur} adds a constant to results of ET/NRET type tests. This ensures that the minimum value of
points can't fall below zero. If you'd rather like to see the results without this constant,
      i.e. results can be negative,
you can rescale them with this function.
