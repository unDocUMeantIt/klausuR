Description: GNU R package "Multiple Choice Test Evaluation"
 .
 A set of functions designed to quickly generate results of a multiple
 choice test. Generates detailed global results, lists for anonymous
 feedback and personalised result feedback (in LaTeX and/or PDF
 format), as well as item statistics like Cronbach's alpha or
 disciminatory power. 'klausuR' also includes a plugin for the R GUI
 and IDE RKWard, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features.
 The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a
 repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of this
 feature, please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org (plugins
 are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the
 full package sources are only available from the project homepage.
