Description: GNU R package: A set of functions designed to quickly generate results of a multiple choice test. Generates detailed
 global results, lists for anonymous feedback and personalised result feedback (in LaTeX and/or PDF format), as well as item
 statistics like Cronbach's alpha or disciminatory power. 'klausuR' also includes a plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard, providing
 graphical dialogs for its basic features. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a repository, as it is
 a part of RKWard. To make full use of this feature, please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org (plugins are detected
 automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the project homepage.
